/**
 * Works around a popup-teardown race in the Midnight dapp connector.
 *
 * Lace opens one popup window per confirmation location and only forgets about
 * it once the window has actually been removed by the browser. Its confirmation
 * side effect latches onto whichever prove-transaction view is in its store when
 * the request arrives — a replayed value — and then resolves the request as
 * *rejected* as soon as that view disappears.
 *
 * A capacity exchange transaction needs two approvals back to back
 * (`balanceUnsealedTransaction`, then `balanceSealedTransaction`) with only local
 * transaction work in between. The second request therefore routinely reaches the
 * wallet while the first popup is still closing: it latches onto the dying popup,
 * never renders a prompt, and fails immediately with "User rejected transaction"
 * even though the user approved everything they were shown.
 *
 * This wrapper avoids that from the dapp side by
 *   1. serialising approval-requiring calls, so two can never be in flight at once,
 *   2. leaving {@link ExtensionApprovalGuardOptions.settleDelayMs} after each one
 *      to give the popup time to finish closing, and
 *   3. retrying a rejection that came back too fast to have been a real person.
 *
 * Read-only methods (balances, addresses, configuration) are passed straight
 * through — they need no approval and must not be delayed.
 *
 * Only wallets known to have the bug are wrapped — see
 * {@link connectMidnightExtension}. The Proxy cannot wrap a connector API the
 * extension froze: `get` must return a frozen property's exact value, never a
 * bound or queued wrapper.
