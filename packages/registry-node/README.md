# @sundaeswap/capacity-exchange-registry-nodejs

The registry is a contract acting as a directory of capacity exchange servers. Each entry maps a server's secret key (hashed on-chain) to a bare domain name and an expiry.

Clients discover servers by querying the registry for non-expired domain names and resolving each one via DNS SRV records (`_capacityexchange._tcp.<domainName>`) using DNS-over-HTTPS.

Servers must lock collateral to register, and get refunded after deregistering.

Entries expire after a configurable maximum period — expired entries can be removed by anyone to reclaim the collateral.

## Well-known registry addresses

For live environments, the `contractAddress` argument is optional — the CLI defaults to the known deployed address for the network.

| Network | Address |
|---------|---------|
| `preview` | `e5e6b7df948c16d7bcd7d5c982e1be3636b08d0d3aa9bd9c710a204714d59aae` |
| `preprod` | `4dd6a6b6b859606f72607de4d1aaeac6196f3b1eb778d0fd5e252c0a68d712bc` |
| `mainnet` | `e1c688c297ef5787b08d8f0078932bba8c091bd5873b155d9793e10bd9a22fd7` |

Pass a contract address explicitly to target a different deployment (e.g. a locally deployed registry).

## Registering a Server to the Registry

**Prerequisites:**
- A wallet (`wallet-mnemonic.<NETWORK_ID>.txt` or `wallet-seed.<NETWORK_ID>.hex`) with unshielded NIGHT funds
- `NETWORK_ID` env var set to `preview`, `preprod`, or `mainnet`

1. [Generate a secret key](#generate-secret) — do this once and keep the file safe
2. [Register your server](#register)
3. [Verify registration](#list-servers)
4. [Renew registration](#renew-registration) — renew before your entry expires to stay listed
5. [Deregister your server](#deregister) — reclaims your collateral
6. [Claim expired registrations](#claim-expired) — anyone can clean up expired entries

---

## Commands

### `generate-secret`

Generates a random 64-byte secret key and writes it hex-encoded to a file. This secret key is hashed and used as a registry key to identify an entry. Keep it safe — it is required to `deregister` or `renew-registration`, and losing it means the collateral can only be recovered after the entry expires.

```sh
NETWORK_ID=preview bun run generate-secret <outputFile>
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `outputFile` | Path to write the generated secret key (hex) to |

**Example**

```sh
NETWORK_ID=preview bun run generate-secret ./my-registry-key.hex
```

---

### `deploy`

Deploys a new instance of the registry contract. Sets the required collateral amount and the maximum registration period for all future entries.

```sh
NETWORK_ID=preview bun run deploy <collateral> [registrationPeriod]
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `collateral` | Required collateral per registered entry (in specks) |
| `registrationPeriod` | Max registration period in days (default: 30) |

**Output**

```json
{
  "contractAddress": "3470c638...",
  "txHash": "95a41b5e...",
  "secretKey": "..."
}
```

---

### `register`

Adds a server to the registry. The SRV record name is stored on-chain under a key derived from the secret key. Clients resolve the SRV record via DNS at connection time. The required collateral is locked and returned on deregistration.

```sh
NETWORK_ID=preview bun run register <secretKeyFile> <domainname> [period] [contractAddress]
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `secretKeyFile` | Path to the secret key file (output of `generate-secret`) |
| `domainname` | Bare domain name (e.g. `sundae.fi`) — must have a `_capacityexchange._tcp.<domainname>` SRV record; the prefix is added automatically |
| `period` | Registration period in days (default: 30 for mainnet, 0.5 for preview/preprod) |
| `contractAddress` | Registry contract address (defaults to well-known address for network) |

**Example**

```sh
NETWORK_ID=preview bun run register ./my-registry-key.hex sundae.fi
```

---

### `deregister`

Removes a server entry from the registry and refunds the collateral to the recipient address. Requires the secret key used when registering.

```sh
NETWORK_ID=preview bun run deregister <secretKeyFile> <recipientAddress> [contractAddress]
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `secretKeyFile` | Path to the secret key file used when registering |
| `recipientAddress` | Bech32m unshielded address to receive the collateral refund |
| `contractAddress` | Registry contract address (defaults to well-known address for network) |

**Example**

```sh
NETWORK_ID=preview bun run deregister \
  ./my-registry-key.hex \
  mn_addr_preview1h8g8wxpyyj3pad65qysndyx5u2wmz5j7ma6dmstd5rmrnqwhkekqh2rs58
```

---

### `claim-expired`

Claims the collateral from an expired registry entry. No secret key is required — anyone can call this once an entry's expiry has passed.

```sh
NETWORK_ID=preview bun run claim-expired <registryKey> <recipientAddress> [contractAddress]
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `registryKey` | Hex-encoded 32-byte registry key of the expired entry (from `list-servers`) |
| `recipientAddress` | Bech32m unshielded address to receive the collateral refund |
| `contractAddress` | Registry contract address (defaults to well-known address for network) |

**Example**

```sh
NETWORK_ID=preview bun run claim-expired \
  080f88efc90226cb61600e5f1708794dbfe453360855e501201a1dead35e99ab \
  mn_addr_preview1h8g8wxpyyj3pad65qysndyx5u2wmz5j7ma6dmstd5rmrnqwhkekqh2rs58
```

---

### `renew-registration`

Extends the expiry of an existing registry entry. The new expiry must be within the contract's `maximumRegistrationPeriod`.

```sh
NETWORK_ID=preview bun run renew-registration <secretKeyFile> [period] [contractAddress]
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `secretKeyFile` | Path to the secret key file used when registering |
| `period` | New registration period in days (default: 30 for mainnet, 0.5 for preview/preprod) |
| `contractAddress` | Registry contract address (defaults to well-known address for network) |

**Example**

```sh
NETWORK_ID=preview bun run renew-registration ./my-registry-key.hex
```

---

### `list-servers`

Returns all registered servers from the registry contract.

```sh
NETWORK_ID=preview bun run list-servers [contractAddress]
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `contractAddress` | Registry contract address (defaults to well-known address for network) |

**Example**

```sh
NETWORK_ID=preview bun run list-servers
```

**Example — explicit address**

```sh
NETWORK_ID=preview bun run list-servers \
  3470c638fca45245a3fd790ba68b24a42fce3c8145584eef8447cc23443bba4d
```

**Output**

```
25d91723c63521a399fb5e232de27c2064fd5241d19df478c16cc4b52ff337a9: {
  "domainName": "sundae.fi",
  "expiry": "2026-05-08T22:13:34.000Z"
},
```
